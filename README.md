# react-starter
A commit-by-commit walkthrough of how to bootstrap a React application

## Getting Started
Install the latest versions of:
* Node.js
* npm

Create a new Git repository with this code as its base:
```sh
mkdir project
cd project
git init
git pull https://github.com/vinsonchuong/react-starter master
```

Install external dependencies with:
```sh
npm install
```

Serve the application with:
```sh
npm start
```

Run tests with:
```sh
npm test
```

Note that the integration tests (under `spec/integration`) assume that the
application is already being served.
